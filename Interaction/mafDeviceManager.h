/**
  Class managing the devices inside a MAF application and the synchronization with wxWindows message pump.
  This class is used both as a container for all active devices and manages synchronization
  of events coming from input devices with wxWindows message pump.
  The synchronization mechanisms is accomplished by executing the "dispatching" on a separate thread, and this is 
  currently imlemented by sending an event on the GUI message pump with a request for dispatching the events. This
  make dispatching to occurs on the right thread @sa mafAgentEventThreaded.

  Device instances can be of two different types: persistent and non-persistent. The first class of devices are
  typically created by the application code, while the seconds are created by user using the Interaction Settings
  configuration dialog. Persistent devices are not stored to disk and neither they are stopped or destroyed when
  a new device configuration is loaded from disk. Typically a non persistent device object pointer should not be
  stored by other componenents, since when loading new configuration these devices are destroyed a new one are 
  created.  An example of persistent device is the mouse, which is created at application start.
  
  To store devices a mafDeviceSet object is internally used as the root of the devices tree. Devices that could have
  subdevices can inherit from mafDeviceSet to correctly manage the start/stop mechanisms of all subdevices.
